# Polyglot

A Gamified .NET Interactive Framework for Teaching and Learning Multi-Language Programming for High School and Undergraduate Students

Currently, Polyglot works with C# and [SysML V2](https://www.omgsysml.org/SysML-2.htm) but we're working on the support for the other .NET Interactive languages (F#, Javascript, ...) as well.

See it in action in the video below!
